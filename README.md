NeuroBoost Engine

AI-Powered Performance Optimization for Smooth and Stable Gaming

NeuroBoost Engine is an intelligent performance optimization tool that uses adaptive system analysis algorithms to improve frame stability (FPS), reduce lag, and allocate resources more efficiently.

The project is designed with an emphasis on security, transparency, and stability without interfering with game files or violating platform rules.

🚀 What NeuroBoost Engine does

NeuroBoost Engine analyzes the current system load and dynamically:

Optimizes CPU and RAM allocation

Improves process priorities

Reduces background load

Stabilizes frame rate

Minimizes microfreezes and FPS drops

Instead of aggressive intervention methods, it uses adaptive resource management logic at the operating system level.

🧠 Why AI?

NeuroBoost Engine uses intelligent algorithms that:

Analyze system behavior in real time

Adapt to different PC configurations

Optimize performance without manual configuration

Learn from load patterns for more accurate adaptation

It's not just a “booster,” but a smart optimization module.

🔒 Security and trust

Does not modify game files

Does not interfere with game processes

Does not use injectors or workarounds

Fully complies with GitHub rules

Open source (if open-source is planned)

NeuroBoost Engine was created as a system optimization tool, not as a game modification.

⚙ Suitable for

Gamers with mid-range PCs

Streaming and gameplay recording

Esports sessions

Improving stability in demanding games

🌍 Project philosophy

NeuroBoost Engine is about pure optimization, transparency, and uncompromising performance.
Minimum intervention — maximum stability.
